## Simple Linear Regression

Delomys body mass and length linear model.

I had ambiguous/inconsistent language for the `fit1` simple linear regression model:
  
- In the model building instructions I suggested the formula `body_length ~ body_mass`.
- In the Model Interpretation section, the corresponding question read: "What is the magnitude of the mass/length relationship?"

A couple of students were confused by this inconsistency and therefore decided to model body mass in terms of body length.
