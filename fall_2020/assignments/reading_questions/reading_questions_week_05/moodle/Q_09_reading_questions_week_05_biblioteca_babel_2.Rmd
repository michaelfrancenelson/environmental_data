```





> There are $25^{1,312,000}$ possible books in the Library.



- Each book in the library has the same number of available positions for the 25 possible characters:

$410 \times 40 \times 80 = 1,312,000$

- Let's define the variable $B$ as the number of books in the Library of Babel:

<div class="questionborder">
### Q1 2 pts

- How many books would the Library contain if you added *one* additional position to the book size?
  - You shouldn't write out any numbers, provide you answer in terms of B.
  
</div>



Solution
========


The expanded library would contain 25 * B books.
