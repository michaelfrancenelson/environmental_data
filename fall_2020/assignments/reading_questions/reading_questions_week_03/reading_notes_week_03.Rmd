# Questions


- Zuur Chapter 4.1.  Focus on the sections below.  We’ll cover some of the other plot types later.
  - Boxplots and conditional boxplots
  - Histograms
  - Scatterplots
  - Pair plots
- McGarigal Chapter 3: Data Exploration, Screening & Adjustments
  - sections 1 – 5.  This covers much of the same material as the Zuur reading.
- McGarigal Chapter 4: Deterministic Functions
  - Sections 1-3, 5
  - section 4:
    - Glance through this section.  Try not to get caught up in the mathematical details.
    - Focus on the figures and the shapes of the functions.
    - We’ll cover the details of selected functions in lecture and discussion.




# My reading notes


## Zuur 4.1

- exploration questions to ask yourself

- examples of assumption problems:
  - PCA and linear relationships
  - overdispersion in GLMs

- "Expect to spend at least 20% of your research time exploring your data."

- Boxplots: Argentinian salt marsh worms example
  - extreme value/outlier figure 4.1
  - spread calculated as interquartile range
  - discusses square root transformation

- the "double zero problem"
  - It is like saying that butterflies and elephants
are similar because they are both absent from the North Pole, the Antarctic
and the moon.


- conditional boxplots

- Cleveland dotplots
  - I find the description very confusing.
  - The concept is not difficult, but I don't love this explanation.

- Histograms: center and [shape of the] distribution

- Conditional histogram
  - good example using squid sex as the conditioning variable


- QQ plots
  - It's easy to explain that we want data to lie on the x=y line.
  - explaining how the QQ plot is constructed is difficult
  - Doesn't make sense to spend time on this plot in class now

- scatterplots

- pairplot: matrix of scatterplots
  - 3 classes of pairplots should be constructed:
    1. pp of all response vars
    1. pp of all predictor vars
    1. pp of all vars
  pp1: multivariate techniques
  pp2: collinearity
  pp3: linearity between predictors and responses

- Coplot (these were really difficult in class last year!)
  - conditional scatterplot
    - can be nominal or continuous
  - Fig 4.10, the upper panel, showing weeks, is so misleading!
    - the upper panel in 4.11 is a little better, but it's not obvious which panel corresponds to which temperature range.
    - They really should be be labeled in some way.
  - continuous conditional variables: can have overlap

- Lattice graphs
  - It's unclear how they are conceptually different from coplots!



## McGarigal 3 sections 1-5

- Purpose of exploration screening + adustments

- data snooping, data dredging, fishing expiditions

- parameters and statistics

- Normal distribution
  - as a reference framework
  - basic for classical stats
  -bell-shaped

- Central tendency
  - mean, median, mode
- Spread/dispersion
  - variance, sd, cv
  - range, IQR, median absolute deviation

- Non-normality
  - skew: assymetry
  - kurtosis: peakedness
     - platy- and -lepto

- Should I mention moments?

- Single variable plots
  - EDF: rank
  - ECDF: cumulative density
  - histograms
    - I like how he describes them as a method fo 'binning'
  - box
  - QQ
    - i like his exploation of the theoretical quantiles: quantiles of a theoretical dataset of the same size

- Measures of association
  - correlation: spearman (rank) and perarson (z-score)
  - covariance and correlation
  - spearman - monotonic

- scatterplot, pairplot, coplot



## McGarigal Ch 4: determinsitic functions

- What is a det. function?
   - good graphic and exploation of determinsiitic vs stochastic processes


- Brown creeper abundance: linear fun
- Brown creeper presence/absence: logit function
  - I like his juxtaposition here

- Striped bass stocking and recruitment: Ricker function

- section 3: phenomenologicla vs. mechanistic functions
  - ph: model parameters do not have an explicit environmental interpretation

- salamander larvae and predation example
  - a priori model of functional response: Holliong type II - saturating (Michaelis-Menten)
  - the quadratic polynomial function fits the data extremely well, better than any of the mechanistic models

# Question Ideas


## General questions

- What is a quantile?
- What is an outlier?


- Reasons to do data exploration?

## Data exploration

### Numerical exploration questions

- Coefficient of variation
  - McGarigal says "The coefficient of variation allows us to compare the spread for variables measured on different scales."
  - is it ok to use on an interval scale (as opposed to a ratio scale?) [not really...]

### Graphical exploration questions

- Zuur figure 4.4: dotplot
  - boxplot is like an aggregation of the dots in a dotplot
  - compare figure 4.3 a and figure 4.4
    - note that axes are flipped


- Types of plots that show all data vs. data summaries

- What is meant by a conditional plot?
  - histogram example in Zuur

- What is meant by univariate and bivariate plot?

### Modeling and function questions

- McGarigal's juxtaposition of brown creeper abundance and presence/absence

- Larval salamander exmaple
  - What were the pros and cons of ricker and quadratic models?
  - consider mechanistic vs. phenomoenological, goodness-of fit,
