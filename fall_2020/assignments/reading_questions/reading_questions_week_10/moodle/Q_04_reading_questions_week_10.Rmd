<div class="instructions">


Consider an experiment looking at plant biomass response to water treatments.

- The three water level treatments are: "low", "med", and "high". 
- The response is plant biomass in grams after 7 weeks of growth.

|                 | Estimate| Std. Error| t value| Pr(>&#124;t&#124;)|
|:----------------|--------:|----------:|-------:|------------------:|
|(Intercept)      | 2.4     |       2.19|  98.371|              0.001|
|waterMed         | 1.3     |       5.12|   0.480|              0.231|
|waterHigh        | 13.6    |       3.48|  24.495|              0.001|

### Q 1 pt (short answer)

- What was the average plant mass, in grams, for the **medium** water treatment?

</div>





Solution
========

### Grading Guide

Answer is 3.7

Students can calculate this from the intercept and the medium water coefficient.

```{r solution}
coeffs = c(2.4, 1.3, 13.6)
x      = c(  1,   1,    0)

sum(coeffs * x)
```
