Consider this table of model coefficients from a plant growth experiment with the following *continuous* predictor variables.

Note: The amount of water, N, and P given to each plant was randomized at the beginning of the experiment.

- Water: 3 - 30 mL per week
- Nitrogen: 1.1 - 42 mg per week
- Phosphorus: 1.1 - 42 mg per week

The response variable was plant biomass accumulation after 17 weeks (in grams).

|:----------------|--------:|----------:|-------:|------------------:|
|(Intercept)      | -1.7    |       0.23|  98.371|              0.061|
|water            |  0.043  |      0.001|   0.480|              0.021|
|nitro            |  0.192  |      0.034|   1.495|              0.007|
|phosph           | -0.027  |      0.014|   0.091|              0.721|

### Q 2 pt (numeric input)

- Using the information in the model coefficient table above, what is the expected biomass for a plant given
  - 10 mL water per week
  - 30 mg nitrogen per week
  - 20 mg phosphorus per week

</div>


Solution
========

### Grading guide

Students need to use the model coefficients in conjunction with the predictor variable values.

It's easiest using vectors:

```{r}
coeffs = c(-1.7, 0.043, 0.192, -0.027)
treats = c(1, 10, 30, 20)
sum(coeffs * treats)
```
The answer is `r sum(coeffs * treats)`.
