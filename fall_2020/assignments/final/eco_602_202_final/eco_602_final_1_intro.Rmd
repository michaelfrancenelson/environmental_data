# Learning Objectives

- Create a set of R examples for your personal reference beyond this course.
- Use the concepts you have learned in the course to perform a complete data analysis.



# Introduction: R Reference

It's very easy to forget R programming concepts if you don't use the often.

A great way to retain the skills that will be important for you going forward is to create a set of examples using the functions you want to remember.

You'll create an R Markdown document containing examples of how to use the basic R components that you need to know.




# Introduction: Data Analysis

For this portion of the final project, you'll perform a data analysis on data collected or two species of small mammals in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.

You'll find the data file, delomys.csv, in the data tab of the course GitHub page.

It includes data extracted from a larger data set:

# GitHub Pages

## Set up your repository for GitHub Pages:


### In RStudio:

1. Open RStudio and make sure that your course RProject is open.
1. Create a 'docs' folder in your base project.
1. Create a new RMarkdown document, save it as `index.Rmd` in your `docs` folder.
1. Add your name and a title to the header section of the document.
1. Click the Knit button.
1. Commit your changes and push to GitHub.


### On GitHub:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
1. Go to 'Settings'
1. Scroll down to the *GitHub Pages* section.
1. You'll see a blurb called **Source** with a dropdown menu.
1. The **None** option will be initially selected.
1. Click the dropdown menu and choose *main*.
1. Another dropdown will appear: select the **/docs** option.
1. Click *save*.


# index.Rmd and index.html

In order to be published on GitHub Pages, your project needs to have a file called `index.html` in your `docs` folder.

- `index.Rmd` will be the R Markdown document in which you'll create your final project's content.


# Final Project Template

Download the file `index_template.Rmd` from the course GitHub page.


# R Markdown Documents

You can create a new markdown document via the File menu in RStudio.

- RMarkdown documents have an '.Rmd' extension.

RMarkdown documents consist of a few basic elements, including:

- Document text.
  - This is the text that will appear in your rendered document (usually html or pdf).
  - Document text may contain links, images, and formatting information.

- Code chunks.
  - These are where you can write your R code.
  - The code will be executed, and the results displayed in the document.
    - You can specify options in the code chunk header.  `echo` and `eval` are two useful options.
