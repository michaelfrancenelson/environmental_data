# Installing R and RStudio on your computer

If you're already a whiz at installing software, feel free to install R and RStudio on your own and jump to the assignment questions.

R is here: https://cran.r-project.org/
RStudio is here: https://rstudio.com/


# Objectives

- Successfully install R on your computer.
- Successfully install RStudio on your computer.


# Instructions

To complete this assignment you'll need to install both R and RStudio on your computer.

Rather than reinventing a wheel that's been invented successfully by many others I'll direct you to some resources with more in-depth instructions for setting up the software:

# Self-Assessment

Once you've successfully set up the software, you should be able to open the RStudio program and see something like this:




```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
build_popup_figure("rstudio_running.PNG", thumb_width = "75%", recursive = TRUE)
# build_popup_figure("rstudio_running.PNG", recursive = TRUE)
# build_popup_figure("rstudio_running.PNG", thumb_width = 75,recursive = TRUE)
# build_popup_figure("rstudio_running.PNG", thumb_width = "75%",recursive = TRUE)
# build_popup_figure("rstudio_running.PNG", thumb_width = "75vw",recursive = TRUE)

```

<!-- ![RStudio session](`r here::here("images", "screenshots", "rstudio_running.PNG")`) -->
