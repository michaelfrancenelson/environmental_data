Question
========

```{r CSS, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
cat(readLines(here::here("formatting", "css", "styles.css")))
```

Create a list, named `my_list_1` with following three elements:

1. first element is numeric:  `5.2`
2. second element is a string `"five point two"`
3. third element is a vector of all integers from 0 to 5.  Do recall how to do this from the DataCamp course?

Name the elements in `my_list_1`:

1. "two"
2. "one"
3. "three"

Run the following lines of code.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

my_list_1[[1]]
my_list_1[[as.numeric("1")]]
my_list_1[["1"]]
my_list_1[["one"]]
my_list_1$one
my_list_1$"one"
my_list_1$1
my_list_1$"1"


```

- Q1 (8 pts): for each subsetting operation, explain why R produced the corresponding output.
  - Identify the type of subsetting operation.
  - Explain how the operation chose which element (1, 2, or 3) to return.
- Q2 (2 pts): Hypothesize why some of the lines may have produced errors or `NULL` outputs.
- Q3 (2 pts): Identify which lines produced the same output and explain why.


Solution
========

- Students should recognize subsetting by index number and element name using square brackets.
- Students should recognize subsetting by dollar sign.
- Students should realize that $ is only for selecting by strings.
- Students should realize that NULL is returned when you try to subset using a name that does not exist in the list.
