## Reading a csv file



I'm going to read some data from a csv (comma-separated-values) file.



I can use read.csv() along with the path to the file to read the data into a data.frame.



Here's an example:



```{r read_birds_data}

require(here)

dat_birds = read.csv(here("data", "hab.sta.csv"))

```





## Previewing the contents of a data.frame



I can use the head() function to print the first few lines of a data.frame.



Here's an example with the birds data



```{r}



```
