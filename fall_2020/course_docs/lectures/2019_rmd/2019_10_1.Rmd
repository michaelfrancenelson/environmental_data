- Likelihood
- Group quiz/activity: Likelihood Functions
- Conditional Probabilities
- Bayesian Intro
- Discrete Bayesian Inference Example




## Correction about Student's t-test

I mistakenly said that R. A. Fischer first published the t distribution. It was William Sealy Gossett

"The t distributions were discovered by William S. Gosset in 1908. Gosset was a statistician employed by the Guinness brewing company which had stipulated that he not publish under his own name. He therefore wrote under the pen name 'Student'."

## Clarifications about Bootstrapping 

from last lecture

Why don't we always use bootstrapping (or other resampling techniques\right), instead of estimating parameters ?
What are the pitfalls of bootstrapping? 
What are advantages of bootstrapping ? 




## Bootstrapping uses

- Estimate standard errors.
- Remember SE is a parameter of the sampling distribution of a statistic , not the population distribution.
- Estimate confidence intervals.
- Helpful with small samples when we don't want to, or can't, assume a theoretical distribution of the population and don't want to rely on the Central Limit Theorem.
 - Recall the Central Limit Theorem doesn't always apply with $n \lt 30$





## Bootstrap pitfalls

- Bootstrap sampling distributions tend to be too narrow: narrowness bias.
- Bootstrap distributions won't fix nonrepresentative or too-small samples.
- Bootstrap estimates of the median can be problematic.
- May be computationally intensive.




## Bootstrap Advantages

- Conceptually simple, easy to implement, may be more intuitive than formulas for calculating standard errors:
 - SE of the mean calculation is simple, but SEs of other statistics are much more complicated.
 - Formulas for $\gt1$ predictor or response can be very complicated!


- Can be used to illustrate concrete examples of theoretical principles:
 - Bootstrapping is a good way to visualize theoretical sampling distribution s 





## Likelihood: The scenario

Main question: How likely am I to have observed the data I collected under my proposed model? 

Likelihood can help if you have: 

1. Data 
1. A proposed a distribution or model of the data 
1. A set of candidate distribution/model parameters 




## Likelihood: independent samples 

- Since you are a whiz at designing experiments, you know that all of your samples are independent!
- What do we already know about the joint probability of multiple, independent events?





## Likelihood: independent samples

- The joint probability of observing multiple independent events is the product of the probabilities of the individual events.
- Likelihood is an estimate of how probable your particular data are given a model and a set of model parameters.

The likelihood is the product of the probabilities of each observation given your model/parameters!




## Likelihood: data and model

How do we calculate the probability for a specific event or observation if we have a theoretical distribution?

What about when we don't have or can't use a theoretical distribution? 




## Likelihood: procedure 

1.Collect data 
2.Propose model and candidate parameter values 
3.Calculate the probability density of each observation given your model and parameter values:
-From a theoretical distribution.
-From an empirical/resampled/simulated distribution





## Likelihood: procedure 

4.Multiply the densities.
-In practice we calculate the logarithm of the densities and add them together.
-Why might this be better than multiplying probabilties?
1.Voil√†: your likelihood value for your data $Y$ given your proposed model and parameter values: $\Phi_m$
-In symbols $L(Y \vert \Phi_m\right)$ 




## Likelihood: maximizing 

For inference: it might seem reasonable to try to find the parameter values that make our observed data most likely.

In Maximum Likelihood inference we want to maximize the likelihood of the parameters.





## Likelihood calculations

Wouldn't it be nice if we had a simple formula? 

- Sometimes we can find a formula and then find it's minima/maxima via calculus.
- Frequently such formulas don't exist.




## Likelihood visualization activity

Before we start, do you remember the Bernoulli distribution?

- What does it describe?
- What are its parameters?

## Conditional Probability

Entire sample space: S S 
Event A S A 
Event B S B 
Both Events, exclusive S A B 

Both events, overlap S A B A and B $Pr\left( B \vert A \right)$ A A and B
- A has already happened. 
- Imagine S collapsing to A. 

$Pr\left( B \vert A \right) \lt Pr\left(A \right)$. $Pr\left( B \vert A \right)$ = $\frac{Pr\left(A and B \right)}{Pr\left(A \right)}$.

$Pr\left( B \vert A \right)$

$Pr\left(A \right) = Pr\left(A and B \right)$

$Pr\left(A \vert B \right)$

B A and B. 

B has already happened. Imagine S collapsing to B. 

$Pr\left(A \vert B \right) \lt Pr \left( B \right)$. 
$Pr\left(A \vert B \right) = Pr\left(A and B \right) / Pr \left( B \right)$. 
$Pr\left(A \vert B \right)$
$Pr\left(B = Pr\left(A and B \right)$ 

Common element in both conditionals:
$Pr\left(A and B \right)$
$Pr\left(A \vert B \right)$
$Pr\left(B = Pr\left(A and B \right)$
$Pr\left( B \vert A \right)$
$Pr\left(A \right) = Pr\left(A and B \right)$

This means:

$Pr\left(A \vert B \right)$

$Pr\left(B = Pr\left( B \vert A \right)$

$Pr\left(A \right)$  

Common element in both conditionals: 

$Pr\left(A and B \right)$
$Pr\left(A \vert B \right)$
$Pr\left(B = Pr\left( B \vert A \right)$

$Pr\left(A \right)$ 

We can rearrange as 2 ratios:
$\frac{Pr\left(A \right)}{Pr\left(B \right)} = \frac{Pr\left(A \vert B \right)}{Pr\left( B \vert A \right)}$

Ratio of unconditioned probabilities is equal to ratio of the conditionals!

But what happens if there is no overlap?

What if $Pr\left(A and B \right)$ is zero?

Conditionals become 0 and we have 

$\frac{Pr\left(A \vert B \right)}{Pr\left( B \vert A \right)} = \frac{0}{0}$

We can't do division by 0! Bayes' rule to the rescue:

$P\left( A \vert B \right) = P \left( B \vert A \right) P \left( A \right) P \left(B\right)$

$P \left( A \vert B \right) = P\left( B \vert A \right)$





## Intro to Bayesian: Bayes' Rule





## Frequentist and Bayesian contrasts

- Relationships between model and data

Frequentist:

- Data are one realization of a stochastic sampling process
- The One True Model exists and is unknowable

Bayesian:

- We know that our data exist, they are not random
- The model is a random variable that we will estimate from our fixed data 





## Uncertainty about the model

Frequentist:

- True model parameters are unknowable but fixed.
  - Population-level model parameters have no distributions, they simply exist!

Bayesian:
- Model parameters are random:
  - They have probability distributions that we estimate from our fixed data.





## Confidence and Credibility

Frequentist 95% confidence interval:

-We are confident that our process would produce intervals containing the true value 95% of the time.
- Certainty about whether a particular interval contains the true value is tricky.

Bayesian 95% credible interval:

- Given our data, we are 95% certain that our particular interval contains the real parameter value.




## Inference: Frequentist 

1. Estimate parameters that make our data most likely, under the assumption that they are one of infinite possible samples.
1. Express our parameter estimates in terms of a confidence intervals and p-values.
  - The CI either contains the param value or not.
  - We can't know for a particular CI.





## Inference: Bayesian 

1.Estimate probability distributions of the parameters that are most likely given our data, and previous data/knowledge.
  - Conditional probability is key
2.Express our estimates in terms of credible intervals.
  - p-values aren't as important.





## Bayesian symbols and notation

Follows the format of conditional probability:

$Pr \left( A \vert B \right$: What is the probability of A given that we know B occurred?
$Pr \left( H \vert D \right)$: What is the probability of our hypothesis (H\right) given that we have observed the data (D\right) 





## Bayesian symbols

Hypothesis comprises our proposed model and a set of model parameter values

- Often denoted $H$ or $\Phi_m$

Data comprises our current and previous data or knowledge

- Denoted D or Y 

There are 4 important probabilities/distributions 




## Four important probabilities/distributions 

1. $Pr \left( Y \right)$: t he probability or likelihood of our observed data 
1. $Pr \left( \Phi_m \right)$: The probability distribution of our model and parameters before data are observed
  - How could we possibly know this before we start?
-Prior probability from previous data, maybe?  Four important probabilities/distributions 
1. $Pr \left( Y \vert \Phi_m \right)$: Probability of observing the current data given our estimated model and the previous data.
-Likelihood function of the model parameters: we want to maximize this function
1. $Pr \left( \Phi_m \vert Y \right)$: Probability distribution of our estimated model parameters after the data are observed.
-This is what we want to infer!
-Posterior probability.  Bayesian: what do we need to proceed? 
1. $Pr \left( H\right)$: Prior unconditional distribution of the probability of our model params 
1. $Pr \left( D\right)$: Unconditional probability of observing the current data:
-This is difficult‚Ä¶but we don't have to know it directly.
1. $Pr \left( D \vert H\right)$: Conditional probability of observing our data given the model parameters.
-Estimated is from the likelihood function.
-Remember likelihood functions aren't trivial to find/define!




## Discrete Bayesian Hypotheses

What if we have a set of exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses?
