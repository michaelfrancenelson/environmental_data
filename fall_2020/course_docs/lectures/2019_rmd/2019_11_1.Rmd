```




## Model thinking: dual models

- Predictors, responses Expected values, model of the means 
- Errors: 4 sources




## Constellation of methods

- Group 1: Linear methods 
- Group 2: Extended linear methods

## Univariate methods snapshot




## Univariate Methods

- We’ll be focusing on about regression-type methods:  Predictors used to explain patterns in a response
- Our models will only consider a single response, but may accommodate multiple predictors




## Group 1 : Linear Models
- Key assumptions: 1. Single response variable: Univariate 2. Independent observations 3. Linear* predictor/response relationships 4. Normally-distributed errors 5. Constant variance: no Heteroscedasticity
- *Linear in the parameters




## Group 1: terms and coefficients

- Response: Y 
- Predictor(s): X
- Intercept(s): alpha Slope(s): beta





## Group 1
- T-Test Simple Linear Regression
- 1-Way ANOVA
- Multiple Linear Regression
- n-Way ANOVA
- ANCOVA




## Group 1: general equation format

- Element-by-element form:
$y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + ... + \beta _n x_{ni} + \epsilon_i$

Vector form:

$\textbf{Y} = \alpha + \beta_1 \textbf X_1 + \beta_2 \textbf X_2 + ... + \beta _n \textbf X_n + \epsilon$




## Linearity in the parameters




## Thunder Basin antelope

- Response: spring fawn count Predictors:

1. Adult population (previous year) 
2. Annual precipitation 
3. Winter severity index (1 – 5)




## Thunder Basin antelope: what are the data types?

- Response: spring fawn count Predictors: 

1. Adult population (previous year) 
2. Annual precipitation 
3. Winter severity index (1 – 5)




## Group 1

- t-test
- Simple Linear Regression
- 1-Way ANOVA
- Multiple Linear Regression
- n-Way ANOVA
- ANCOVA




## t-test

- One categorical predictor with 1 or 2 levels
- One continuous response




## t-test

- Analyzes the following questions:

1. Is the mean of one group different from a fixed value? 
2. Are the means of two groups different from each other ?

- t-test elaboration

1. 1-way ANOVA extends t-test to 3 or more groups.




## What antelope questions could we address with t-tests?

- Hint: What are the categorical predictors?




## Group 1

- t-test
- Simple Linear Regression
- 1-Way ANOVA
- Multiple Linear Regression
- n-Way ANOVA
- ANCOVA




## Simple Linear Regression

- One continuous response
- One continuous predictor
- What questions could we address in the antelope data?




## Simple Linear Regression elaborations
1. Multiple linear regression: More than one continuous predictors 2. ANOVA: One categorical predictor (instead of continuous) 3. ANCOVA: Mixture of categorical and continuous predictors




## Group 1
- t-test
- Simple Linear Regression
- 1-Way ANOVA
- Multiple Linear Regression
- n-Way ANOVA
- ANCOVA




## Multiple Linear Regression
- One continuous response
- Two or more continuous predictors




## Multiple Linear Regression
- Attempts to quantify the pairwise relationships between each predictor and the response .
- Can consider interactions :
-  combined effect of 2 or more predictors on the response
- Multiple regression can fail with highly correlated predictors .




## Multiple Linear Regression elaboration
- Mixture of categorical and continuous predictors: Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)




## Multiple Linear Regression: what questions could we address in the antelope data?




## Group 1
- t-test
- Simple Linear Regression
- 1-Way ANOVA
- Multiple Linear Regression
- n-Way ANOVA
- ANCOVA




## Analysis of Variance - ANOVA
- Categorical predictor, 3 or more levels
- Continuous response
- Analyzes the following questions:
1. Are the group means different from one another?
- Note: ANOVA does not specify which pairs of groups are different from one another.




## ANOVA: What could we ask with the antelope data?




## ANOVA elaborations
- Two or more categorical predictors: multi - way ANOVA
- Categorical and continuous predictors: Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)
- Post - ANOVA analysis: which groups are different from one another?
-  For example: Multiple testing corrections, Tukey Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test, Bonferroni correction, etc
- 



## Group 1
- t-test
- Simple Linear Regression
- 1-Way ANOVA
- Multiple Linear Regression
- n-Way ANOVA
- ANCOVA




## Multi - way ANOVA
- Categorical analogue of multiple regression Main effects, interactions Is multi - way ANOVA applicable to the antelope data? Elaboration: Mix of categorical and continuous variables – Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)




## Group 1
- t-test
- Simple Linear Regression
- 1-Way ANOVA
- Multiple Linear Regression
- n-Way ANOVA
- ANCOVA




## Analysis of Covariance ANCOVA
- Categorical and continuous predictors Continuous response What about the antelope data?




## Group 1 model summary presentations
1. Table of model coefficients – model summary, strength of effects of predictors, overall model significance test 2. ANOVA table – model variability attributed to each factor, factor - specific significance tests




## Group 1 model summary interpretation: coefficients
1. Intercept: What is the value of the response when the predictor has value zero? 2. Slope: What is the change in the response with each unit change in the predictor? 3. Standard Errors: shape of sampling distribution 4. F - test: overall model significance test




## Simple Linear Regression: Iris petal width predicted by petal length




## Multiple regression: petal width predicted by petal length, sepal length




## ANOVA: Species and petal width




## ANCOVA: species and petal length




## Group 1 ANOVA table interpretation
1. Degrees of freedom: Reflects the number of samples, number of factor levels, number of individuals per factor level etc. 2. Sum of squares: Reflects the total squared deviation from the mean explained by a source. 3. Mean squares: Mean SS due to a source (per DF) 4. F - tests: Test for ratio of variability explained by a source




## 1-way ANOVA




## ANOVA table for an ANCOVA




## ANOVA table vs. model coefficient table
- Model coefficient table tells you:
1. Intercept and slope coefficients 2. Overall model significance test, correlation test
- ANOVA table tells you:
1. Variability explained by each factor in the model 2. Significance tests for each factor separately




## When do group 1 methods start to fail?




## Recall some of the key group 1 assumptions.
- Independent observations Linear relationships Normal errors Constant variance




## Nonlinear relationships
- Try adding terms: polynomial, power, interaction Try a data transformation Other options: 1. Additive models 2. Nonlinear least squares




## Non-normal errors
- Data transformation Generalized linear models




## Non constant variance
- Data transformation GLS




## Non independent observations
- Autocorrelation Spatial dependence Repeated measurements Correlated error structures




## Complicated experimental scenarios
- Pseudoreplication Too many zeroes Blocking, random effects, nesting, hierarchical models Categorical responses




## For next time:
- Select group paper for critical paper review
- Group 2: extended linear techniques.
