## Today's Meeting

- Course Themes
- In-class group activity
- For next week




## Announcements and Questions

- DataCamp intro to R questions are now live on Moodle
- Questions or thoughts?




## Model Thinking

What is it?






## The Dual Model Paradigm

### It's useful to think of a system with

- An expected typical or average behavior.
- A range of natural variation that we expect to see around the average behavior.

The **Dual Model Paradigm** is a way to think about modeling natural systems in which we specify two models: a deterministic and a stochastic.




## Determinsitic Models

A **deterministic** model describes expected, or average behavior.

- The deterministic model describes a relationship between a response and one or more predictors.
- It is often known as a **model of the means**.
- We commonly use a deterministic model to address our primary questions, such as:
  - How does % forest cover correspond with salamander populations?
  - How do predator populations and winter temperatures correlate with prey populations?




## Stochastic Models

A **stochastic** model describes variability.

- Stochastic models can help understand the possible range of behaviors in our model.
- We use the stochastic model to assess the **significance** of our **statistical inferences**. 
- Probability theory
- Probability distributions



## Uncertainty

Uncertainty comes in many forms.

> there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknownsâ€”the ones we don't know we don't know. - Donald Rumsfeld




## Uncertainty

- Possible sources of 'error', a.k.a uncertainty
  - process error
  - measurement error
  - model error
  






## Mathematical and Statistical Modeling

### Fitting models to data (not the other way around) is an art... you have to:
  - be familiar with the range of possible models
  - know how to choose a deterministic model
  - know how to choose a stochastic model
  - be able to understand assumptions, formulae, and other technicalia
  
### This is perhaps the most technical and intimidating part of the course.
  - We'll focus on intuition-building



## In-class activity

- Find the instructions on Moodle
- I've pre-assigned groups on Moodle
- Complete the activity today during class
  - Submit your group's materials at the end



## For Next Week

- Read the Bolker selections by next Tuesday.
- Reading questions (including info for all the other readings) will be due next Thursday.
