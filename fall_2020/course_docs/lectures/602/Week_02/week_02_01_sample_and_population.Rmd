## Concepts and Learning Objectives


- Key differences between population and sample
- Parameters and statistics
- Description and inference
- Statistical and ecological populations
- Sampling units


## Populations and samples

### Populations are large
- We [typically] **cannot observe all** individuals in a population
  - This is a cornerstone of Frequentist thinking
- We have to make informed guesses about the population from *samples*

### Samples are a subset of a population
- We **can observe all** sampling units in a sample
- We can completely characterize the properties of a sample

### We use the sample to make informed guesses about the population




## Populations, samples, parameters, and statistics

### Population/sample and parameter/statistic are *parallel* concepts

- **Populations** have ***parameters***, intrinsic characteristics of the entire population.
  - We can't calculate population parameters directly.
- We can calculate ***statistics*** from **samples**.

### We use **statistics** to infer information about population **parameters**

- This is the basis for *inferential statistics*.




## Samples, Sampling Units, and Variables

- A sample is a **group of observations** taken from a larger *population*.
- A sampling unit (SU) is the unit/entity/thing of interest for the research question.
- A variable is an attribute of the SU




## Populations, Samples, Sampling Units, and Variables

### All of these concepts form a *nested* structure:

- A statistical population is [usually] a subset of an ecological population
- A sample is a subset of a statistical population
- One sampling unit is a subset of a sample
- A Variable is a quantity measured on a single sampling unit




## Statistical and ecological populations

### We'll use Bullheads to illustrate the differences.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="75%", fig.cap="Brown Bullhead illustration by Duane Raver (USFWS)"}
knitr::include_graphics(find_file("brown_bullhead.jpg"))
```



## What is an ecological, or biological, population?

### The collection of all possible sampling units.
- The scale of the research question may or may not encompass the entire ecological population.
- A *statistical population* is usually a subset of the *ecological population*.
- A ecological population does not generally vary based on the scope of a research question.

### Bullhead ecological population: entire species range




## What is a statistical population?

### The statistical population depends on the scope of the *research question*

- Suppose we were studying bullhead in a single lake:
  - ecological population: entire species range
  - statistical population: the lake
  
- What about bullhead in Massachusetts?
  - ecological population: entire species range
  - statistical population: all bullhead within MA

- Note that the ecological population did not change.




## Bullhead sampling units and variables

### Which bullhead attributes might we want to measure or observe?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="75%", fig.cap="https://www.koaw.org/measuring-fishes"}
knitr::include_graphics(find_file("Measuring_Bony_Fishes_tfs.png"))
```



## Bullhead sampling units and variables

### Both the sampling unit and variables are context-dependent

- Suppose we were studying bullhead in a single lake:
  - sampling unit could be individual fishes
  - variable might be total length

- Suppose we wanted to compare average bullhead size in multiple lakes
  - The sampling unit might be *individual fishes* or *individual lakes*
  - The choice of SU would depend on our question




## Sampling units are context dependent: McGarigal testimonies

### Some interrelated questions to ask yourself for each testimony:

- What are the spatial and temporal scales?
- What is the statistical population?
- What are the sampling units?





<!-- ## Testimony 1 -->


<!-- What is the *ecological population*? -->

<!-- What is the *statistical population*? -->

<!-- What is the *sampling unit*? -->

<!-- What are the *variables*? -->

<!-- What are the *temporal* and *spatial scales*? -->



## Testimony 1: Spatio-temporal scales

- Temporal scale:
  - Observations were taken yearly for 10 years.
- Geographic scale: 
  - A single mountaintop in the White Mountains National Forest



## Testimony 1: Variables

### Which quantities were measured?
1. year
1. 'upper elevational distribution'
  - This is vague in the text... 
    - Is it the elevation of the highest observed nest?
    - Is it an average elevation of all nests of a set of high elevation species?



## Testimony 1: Populations and sampling units

### Populations
- Statistical: Collection of nesting sites on one peak
- Ecological: All possible nesting sites of the bird species considered.

### Sampling units
- The SU appears to be individual nesting sites.
  - But recall the ambiguity from the previous slide
  



## Testimony 3: Scales

- Temporal scale:
  - Observations were taken yearly for 10 years.
- Geographic scale: 
  - Entire White Mountains National Forest
- Same variables as before: year, 'upper elevational distribution'



## Testimony 3: Populations and sampling units
  
### Populations

- Statistical population: Collection of nesting sites on all peaks in the White Mountains
- Ecological population: All possible nesting sites of the bird species considered.

### Sampling units
- Appears to be individual nesting sites.
  - But recall the ambiguity from testimony 1
  
- The SU could also be individual mountain tops within the White Mountains in this testimony
