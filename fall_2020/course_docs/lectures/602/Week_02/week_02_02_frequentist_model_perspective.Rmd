## What is Frequentism?

### Inferential framework
- Most widely used framework: has many pros and cons
- Requires assumptions
  They are often reasonable, but sometimes not
- Many tools are robust to violations of assumptions
- Powerful theoretical basis and sophisticated analytical tools
- Frequentism focuses on the modeling *process*, not the outcomes of a particular experiment

### Other frameworks exist...




## Frequentism essentials

### Key Frequentist assumptions include
- Population exists, is infinite.
- Population parameters are true, but unknowable quantities.
- When we specify a model, there exist **true** model parameters (but they are unknowable).


### Frequentism is based upon hypothetical infinite resampling
- Frequentist assumptions are often **asymptotically** true.
- Source of misconceptions about terminology

### Hypothesis testing: $H_0$ and $H_a$




## Null and Alternative models

### Hypothesis testing: allows for quantification of *confidence* and *significance*.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.cap="bigmedium.com/ideas/mvp-does-not-mean-what-you-think-it-means.html"}
knitr::include_graphics(find_file("that_word_does_not_mean_what_you_think_it_means.jpg"))
```



## Note on terminology

### *Confidence* or *significance*: Frequentist definition

- Constructing a 95% confidence interval does **not** mean you are 95% sure your interval contains the true value!
  - It either does or does not, but you can't know.
- "If I were to repeat the experiment many times, approximately 95% of the CIs I construct would contain the true population parameter"

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="28%", fig.cap="A set of 200 95\\% Confidence Intervals" }
print(ggp_95)
```




## Null Models: $H_0$

- McGarigal calls it the *status quo*.  I think of it as what to expect if variables **are not related**.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.cap="A null model", fig.asp = 0.7}
plot_grid(h0)

```



## Alternative Models: $H_a$

- What we expect to observe when quantities are **coordinated** in their variation.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.cap="An alternative model", fig.asp = 0.7}
plot_grid(h1)
```




## Modeling in a Frequentist world

### Frequentist modeling implements the **Dual Model Paradigm**

### Focus is on modeling process
- A particular parameterization of a model is just one of infinitely many possible realization of a **stochastic process** process.
- Model realizations are our best guess about the **true** but **unknowable** model parameters.




## Frequentist conceptual difficulties

### Frequentist confidence is based on **hypothetical infinite repeated sampling**.
- Frequentist *confidence* and *significance* refer to repeating the process many times.

### A particular sampling/modeling process may or may not be a good approximation of the real population.
- A particular CI either *does* or *does not* contain the true value.  In the Frequentist world we can never know.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### This is heady stuff
- It *is* possible to gain intuition - it requires , but it usually takes a lot of thinking and multiple exposures.
=======
### These concepts are difficult.
- One of the best ways to gain intuition is to explain to non-scientists.
