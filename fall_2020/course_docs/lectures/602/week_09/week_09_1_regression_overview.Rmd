## Key Concepts

- What is a regression model?
- What are the key assumptions?
- What is the constellation of methods?


```{r reg_overview_slides, child = find_file("regression_overview_1.Rmd")}

## There are Many Types of Models: The Constellation

```



## There are Many Types of Models: The Constellation

- Many of the models beyond Group 1 were developed to handle violations of one or more of the Group 1 required assumptions.


- We'll spend most of our time on Group 1 models:
  - Easiest to understand, many principles transfer to other models.
  - Easiest to implement and interpret
