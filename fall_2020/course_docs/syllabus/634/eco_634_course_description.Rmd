# Course Description {.tabset}

	
This laboratory course introduces the statistical computing language R and provides hands-on experience using R to screen and adjust data, examine deterministic functions and probability distributions, conduct classic one- and two-sample tests, utilize bootstrapping and Monte Carlo randomization procedures, and conduct stochastic simulations for ecological modeling. 

Specifically, lab focuses on learning the R language and statistical computing environment, which serves as the computing platform for all ECO statistics courses; emphasis is on learning fundamental R skills that will allow students to grow and expand their expertise in subsequent courses or on their own.
